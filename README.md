The Gateway effect of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Marijuana:  Does the Use of Legal Drugs Increase the Risk of Illegal Drug Use?

## Abstract
Alcohol and tobacco are legal, and marijuana is becoming legal in more states every year. Regardless of legality, they are widely available to users of all ages. This begs the question: do users of alcohol, tobacco, and/or marijuana tend to move on to harder illegal drugs such as heroin and cocaine? In this study, I used data analysis, statistics, and machine learning to answer this question. I used data obtained from the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality that includes responses for questions about demographics, tobacco use, alcohol use, marijuana use and illicit drug use, including historical and current habits of each individual respondent.
